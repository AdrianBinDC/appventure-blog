[[http://www.quotevault.org][QuoteVault]] was my first forray into Cloud Computing back in 2008. Back then I was studying myself and needed a better way of organizing and sorting the various quotes and snippets that I compiled when I was researching.

Sadly, I was always afraid of what would happen if it would actually take off, so I never advertised it or even tried to invite users to use it. The original pitch was as follows:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
QuoteVault is a service which allows to collect citations and quotes from digital and analog media. Primarily aimed at collecting quotes during your daily web safari, QuoteVault excels at helping you in collecting, sorting and grouping of said media. A comfortable bookmarklet aids in fetching quotes while you browse or read (almost) any site. After you collected a quote, you can add meta-information to it.
#+END_QUOTE

*** Base Use Case:

QuoteVault was targeted at journalists or academics who often find quotes online that help to form ideas and want to group these together. It extended the classic idea of bookmark-management by helping to not only bookmark a site but also by giving information on just why it was bookmarked. It could also export quotes to a weblog as some sort of 'Quote Blog'

** Auto Blog

Later on, I expanded upon the weblog idea and added a full blown 'Quote Blog' to it. [[http://quotevault.appspot.com/public/terhechte][Here's an example of such an automated quote blog running on QuoteVault.]]
The idea here was that users could collect their posts, or browse other quote blogs, like them, share them, and in the end I would have a database of valuable linkes to content interesting enough that people share it. It could have been a starting point for a domain specific search engine (good books, good papers, etc). Sadly, I never really went there because other projects in life took over.

** Technical Stack
- As already mentioned earlier, QuoteVault was my first Cloud Project. I build it on [[http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_App_Engine][Google App Engine]] right when it was announced. 
- The whole Project is made with Python & Django
- It uses the Prototype.js framework instead of Jquery because back then Prototype seemed to be the better solution (at least to me).
- I learned a lot about nosql databases by optimizing the project for the BigTable datastore, for example 'Sharding'.
- All in all the whole project is rather slow due to the way I build it back then. In hindsight there're lots of ways to write more optimized Python and to design the database in a better way. But it was still a great learning experience.
  
** Afterthought
I should have done some marketing for this, I didn't even really show it to friends. I'm not particularly sure why that is, but I think the fear of failure was really high. I was also afraid that this project would take off and the server costs would kill me. After all, there's no monetization strategy in there.

Sometimes I'm still wondering if it is worth continuing where I left off, but there're so many other projects.
